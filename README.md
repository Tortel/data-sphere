data-sphere
===========

A VR playground for viewing data visualizations beyond the bounds of monitor's form factor.  This project will pull together various JavaScript visualization libraries to explore new ways to play with data.

Current contents include project setup and build files along with the Leap Motion ThreeJS boilerplate HTML and an example D3/ThreeJS visualization done by Steven Hall of delimited.io.  These will be replaced with more custom code as the repo is fleshed out.  For now they serve to proof out the grunt/bower setup and pulling in required libraries.
